<div class="middle-section">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust </li>
        <li>⅔ (16 ounce) jar cheese sauce (such as Ragu® Double Cheddar), divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place pizza crust on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatappi in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 11 minutes. Drain and return pasta to the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir 1/2 the cheese sauce and butter into the cavatappi pot over medium heat until butter is melted and pasta-cheese mixture is combined. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of cheese sauce over the pizza crust. Sprinkle shredded Cheddar cheese over the cheese sauce onto the crust. Pour pasta-cheese mixture over the Cheddar cheese, and top with another 1/2 the cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake pizza in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes. Let rest for 2 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ul>
