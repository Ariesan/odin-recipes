    <h1>Summertime Mango Drink</h1>
    <p class="intro">Mango is well- known as the king among the tropical fruits, it is rich in vitamin A which the content extremely high up to 3.8% and the content of soluble nutrient is 14-24.8%, what's more, mango contains all kinds of chemical elements which are helpful to our body.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite drinks of the summer. It's really easy and takes only 5 minutes or less to prepare. My husband cannot get enough of it. If you want to serve 6 to 8 people, just double the ingredients.</p>
